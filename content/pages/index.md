          BRN is the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the
          round pegs in square holes… the ones who see things differently--
          they’re not fond of rules, they have no respect for the status quo.
          You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. But
          the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things…
          They push the human race to the stars. They are writing the foundation
          for a new interworld order, through science.
