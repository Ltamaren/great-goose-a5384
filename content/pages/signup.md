Humanity. We are Thumpasaurus. We are travelers from the future with an urgent message. Earth is a chaotic landscape of hell and the great race to engineer the perfect consumer is only in its infancy. At this time Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos still compete over which social media you will choose to view the Apocalypse. Please advise, we will relay our message through the musical project THUMP and their token BARNCOIN. The genre of Thump which will sound new to you, but on Earth 2021 it might sound like “a hybrid of Jazz, new wave, funk and pop.” (\*Study-of-pop-music-mind-control 2nd galaxy edition) We are communicating to you through our signals packaged in meme culture, Powerpoint dance and photon enfolded cryptocurrency, because that is what our history book said was “hip” at the time.  (\*babyMusk’s history of Earth edition %\*\*#) Our quest is to save earth from self-destruction by spreading the philosophy of Thump through the examination of what you call “mental-health, humor and empowerment” Our culture calls this (big tree) “ha ha ha ha ha ha” (\*history of Earth – barkbarkedition) We desperately urge you to LIVE RIGHT NOW before its too late… (\*TheGIANT-WARNING 5th edition \*&%^) We will deliver our next package via time travel and will bring our Space Barn across America and Europe in 2021 Jesus Christ time. You must begin writing the future template to avoid timeline 0002. Disregard this message if the world ends in this timeline before we arrive. Thank you, long live the THUMP.
